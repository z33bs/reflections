What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	adds the .git metadata directory
	tell git to start monitoring status of directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	It tells git which files to track or bundle with a commit. Working directory is a normal directory, repository is a collection of commits.
	Staging area just says what will be committed

What value do you think it offers?
	more control over which files to track. 
	perhaps you don't want to track all of your files, making the diff unweildy
