What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	adds the .git metadata directory
	tell git to start monitoring status of directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	It tells git which files to track or bundle with a commit. Working directory is a normal directory, repository is a collection of commits.
	Staging area just says what will be committed

What value do you think it offers?
	more control over which files to track. 
	perhaps you don't want to track all of your files, making the diff unweildy
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	by only adding files that relate to one logical step
	you can review the changes to the working directory by using git diff
	you can see the changes from the last commit using --staged

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When you want to try something experimental
	When you want to create two different versions
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	by seeing which nodes are connected to which parents
	allow to view new branches
	allow to visualise detatched HEAD (reachability)
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
